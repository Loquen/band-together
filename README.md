Band Together is a platform for music venues and concert goers to vend and purchase tickets to musical events. Those with proper credentials may add events to their venue, where said event will be displayed on our 'View Events' page. If there is an event that interests you, simply click on the its respective card to be redirected to its detail page. Here you will see the date, genre, a short description, a map displaying the venue's location, and a button to add tickets, along with edit and delete buttons should you have the proper credentials. On the 'My Profile' page you can view your purchased tickets to upcoming events.
